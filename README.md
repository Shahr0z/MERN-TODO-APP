# ReactJS and Node.js with Express Backend API

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Other dependencies...

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ````bash
   https://github.com/Shahr0z/MERN-TODO-APP.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ````bash
   cd your-repo

3. Install the dependencies for both the frontend and backend:

   ````bash
   cd frontend
   npm install

   cd backend
   npm install

4. Start the frontend development server:

   ````bash
   cd frontend
   npm start

5. Start the backend server:

   ````bash
   cd backend
   npm start

6. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application.

## Backend API Endpoints

The backend API provides the following endpoints:

- **GET /todolist**: Retrieve all todos.
- **POST /todo**: Create a new todo.
- **PUT /todoupdate/:id**: Update a todo by ID.
- **GET /todostatus/:id**: Change the status of a todo by ID.
- **DELETE /tododelete/:id**: Delete a todo by ID.

Each endpoint performs the corresponding CRUD operation on the todos.

## Frontend Structure

The frontend is built using ReactJS and organized in a simple structure:

- **src/components**: Contains reusable components.
- **src/api**: Responsible for making API requests.

Feel free to modify and extend the application as needed to fit your requirements.
